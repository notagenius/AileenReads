# AileenReads
I read 100 books every year as a happy changelle, little fun. it starts since 2016， in 2016 I didn't record what I read。 In 2017, i didn't take notes. In 2018, I started to take notes in github. yeah

## What I have finished in 2018
1. Between The World and Me (probably one of the best books I have ever read)
2. How to build a logo （I like NICK <3）
3. The Hard Thing About Hard Things （3/5）
4. The Non-Designer's Design Book （2/5 it is a good book but quiet out of date. the trend has changed now, but the font chapter still rules）
5. Simple and Usable Web,Mobile,and Interaction Design （4/5 very great 4 principles, the more I thought about it, the more mind-blowing I found out）
6. Rod Machado's Ground School Training Syllabus (3/5 without a real lecture and practice, I am lost a little, need a flight simulator!)
7. The Nature of Code （5/5 such a humble but glory book, this is the learning I will never get tired of）
8. ZERO to ONE （4/5 I can really get connected with the book, but I felt disconnected with the world. Person doing 1 to n）
9. The Node Beginner Book (4/5 you don't want to learn a new technique by just hacking around and mis-using it; you want to be sure that you are approaching it from the right angle. )
10。 OpenGL SuperBible: Comprehensive Tutorial and Reference （what is going on... it is like a mission impossible to go on the tutorial）
